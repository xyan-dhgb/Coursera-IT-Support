# Types of Software

## Copyright

- Copyright protects original works, including software, allowing developers to control its use and distribution.

- Software can be commercial (requiring licenses) or open source (free to share and modify), with examples like Linux and LibreOffice.

## Software Categories

- Application software fulfills specific needs (e.g., text editors, web browsers).

- System software keeps the core system running, including operating systems and utilities, with firmware being a permanent software stored on hardware (e.g., BIOS).

## Software Versions

- Software versions indicate feature updates, typically following a sequential numbering system (e.g., 1.2.5 vs. 1.3.4).

- Understanding software functionality is easier once you learn how one piece of software works.
