# Recipe for Computing

## Early Programming Methods

- In the 1950s, **punch cards** were used to store programs, representing binary code for CPUs to execute instructions.

- The process was tedious, requiring stacks of punch cards for program storage.

## Introduction of Assembly Language

- Assembly language was developed to provide **human-readable instructions** that could be **translated into machine code**

- While an improvement over binary code, assembly language still required knowledge of **specific CPU instructions**.

## Advancements with Compiled and Interpreted Languages

- Compiled programming languages, introduced by Admiral Grace Hopper, **convert human-readable instructions into machine code**, allowing programs to run on various CPUs.

- Interpreted languages, on the other hand, are executed by an interpreter at runtime, often referred to as scripts, enabling dynamic execution of code.
