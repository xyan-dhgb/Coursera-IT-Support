# Revisiting Abstraction

## Understanding Hardware and Software Interaction

- Programs are instructions sent to a CPU, which can vary by manufacturer and hardware configuration.

- Writing a unique program for every hardware combination is impractical due to the vast number of configurations.

## The Role of Abstraction in Programming

- Abstraction allows programmers to write code in high-level programming languages.

- This code can be executed on different hardware without needing to tailor it for each specific configuration.
