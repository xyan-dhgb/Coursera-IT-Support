# Module 3: Operating Systems

## Overview

In this module, learners will dive into the world of **operating systems (OS)** — the critical software layer that bridges computer hardware and user applications. You’ll gain a **solid understanding** of the most widely used OSes today, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, and explore how they manage system resources and processes.

The module covers the full boot process — from powering on the machine to launching the OS — and provides **step-by-step guidance** on installing each system. To reinforce learning, you'll engage in practical, hands-on labs to interact with Windows and Linux environments directly.

## Objectives

- Identify and explain the core components of an operating system.
- Understand how the operating system boots and initializes.
- Perform OS installations for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Create and manage files using both Windows and Linux systems.
