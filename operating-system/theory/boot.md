# Boot

## Boot Process Overview

- The computer is powered on, initiating the BIOS/UEFI, which initializes hardware components.

- A power-on self-test (POST) is performed to ensure the computer is functioning properly.

## Boot Device Selection

- The BIOS/UEFI checks the configured boot order of devices (hard drives, USB drives, etc.) to find a bootloader.

- The bootloader is a small program that loads the operating system once found.

## Operating System Loading

- After the bootloader, the operating system's kernel is loaded, which manages access to system resources.

- Essential system processes and user interfaces are launched, allowing user interaction with the system.
