# Files and Files System

## File System Overview

- The kernel is responsible for handling file storage and file systems, which are essential for tracking numerous files on a computer.

- Different operating systems utilize various file systems, such as NTFS for Windows and EXT4 for Linux, each with unique features and purposes.

## File Data Storage

- Data is stored in blocks on the hard drive, allowing for faster access and better utilization of storage space.

- Block storage enables data to be fragmented and written in different locations, improving performance.

## File Metadata

- Metadata contains crucial information about files, such as creation date, modification date, and access permissions.

- File extensions, like .jpg for image files, help identify the type of file and are important for file management within the operating system.
