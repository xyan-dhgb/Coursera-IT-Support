# Mobile Operating System

## Mobile Device Types

- General-purpose mobile devices, like tablets and smartphones, use mobile operating systems derived from other OSs (e.g., Android from Linux, iOS from MacOS).

- Specialized mobile devices, such as fitness trackers and e-readers, often utilize custom operating systems tailored for specific tasks.

## Power Optimization

- Mobile operating systems are designed to minimize power consumption, allowing devices to last longer between charges by removing unnecessary features.

- The interaction methods on mobile devices (motion, touch, voice) require additional device drivers and support not typically found in desktop or server OSs.

## Custom Operating Systems

- Specialized devices may run on slimmed-down custom OSs optimized for minimal hardware and battery usage.

- These custom OSs may be built using specialized chips and peripherals (thiết bị ngoại vi), which general-purpose operating systems may not support.
