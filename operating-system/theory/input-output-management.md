# I/O Management

## Kernel Management of I/O Devices

- The kernel handles various I/O devices such as monitors, keyboards, mice, and network adapters.

- It loads drivers to facilitate communication between the operating system and hardware, managing data transfer in and out of devices.

- Inter-Device Communication

- The kernel ensures that devices can communicate with each other efficiently.

- It determines the best methods for data transfer and minimizes errors during the process.

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

- Common performance issues often stem from hardware resource deficiencies, such as insufficient RAM or CPU power.

- Identifying resource bottlenecks is crucial for improving performance in IT support roles, especially in larger systems like web applications.
