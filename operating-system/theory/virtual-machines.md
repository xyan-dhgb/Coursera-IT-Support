# Virtual Machines

## Understanding Virtual Machines

- A virtual machine is a copy of a physical machine, allowing users to run multiple operating systems without needing additional hardware.

- VMs utilize physical resources like memory and CPU, providing isolation and ease of maintenance.

## Benefits of Using Virtual Machines

- VMs enable IT support specialists to create new virtual computers on-demand and reclaim resources when no longer needed.

- They are useful for running software specific to one operating system and can be deleted after use.

## Practical Application in Learning

- Throughout the course, learners will use VMs for hands-on exercises on the Quick Labs platform, completing specific tasks to gain practical experience.
