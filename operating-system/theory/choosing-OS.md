# Choosing an Operating System

## Choosing an Operating System

- Determine if a decision has already been made regarding the operating system based on organizational needs.

- Consider the software requirements and hardware compatibility, including CPU architecture (32-bit vs. 64-bit).

## Installing the Operating System

- Understand that many computers come with a pre-installed operating system, which may require additional configuration.

- Use various installation media, such as USB drives or disks, to install the operating system, keeping scalability in mind for future installations.

## Practical Considerations

- Focus on using a USB drive for installation, as it is a common method for both Windows and Linux operating systems.

- Be aware of the need for specific configurations, such as setting a computer name or configuring network settings during installation.
