# Understanding Operating Systems

## Components of OS

- An operating system (OS) consists of two main parts: the kernel and the user space.

    - The kernel is the core component that manages hardware and system resources, 
    
    - while the user space includes everything users interact with directly, such as applications and interfaces.

## Types of Operating Systems

- Major operating systems include Windows (developed by Microsoft), Mac OS (by Apple), and Linux (an open-source OS).

- Linux is notable for its community-driven development and various distributions like Ubuntu and Red Hat.

## Functions of the Kernel

- The kernel performs essential functions: file management (organizing data), process management (handling multiple tasks), memory management (optimizing memory usage), and input/output (IO) management (communicating with external devices).

- Understanding these functions is crucial for working with different operating systems in IT support.
