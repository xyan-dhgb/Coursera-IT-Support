# Interacting with the OS: User Space

## Userspace Interaction

- Users interact with operating systems through two main interfaces: 
    - Command Line Interface (CLI)
    - Graphical User Interface (GUI).

- A CLI allows users to execute commands using text, while a GUI provides a visual interface for interaction, often using a mouse.

## Importance of Shells

- Shells interpret text commands and send them to the operating system for execution; they remain essential for power users, especially in Linux environments.

- Knowing how to use a shell is crucial in IT support roles, as many tasks can only be completed through command-line operations.

## Common Shells

- The most common shell used in Linux is Bash (Bourne Again SHell).

- Different shells have various features and performance characteristics, similar to different operating systems.
