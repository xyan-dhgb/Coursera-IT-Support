# Basics of Networking

## Understanding the Internet

- The Internet is a vast network of interconnected computers, often likened to a spider web.

- It consists of various networks, including home, school, and workplace networks, all linked together.

## Distinction Between Internet and World Wide Web

- The Internet refers to the physical connections of computers, while the World Wide Web is the information accessed through it.

- Other means of accessing the Internet include email and chat applications.

## Networking Basics

- Networking is a crucial field in IT, involving the management and design of networks.

- Clients (devices like computers and phones) connect to the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs), which manage the physical infrastructure.

## Data Transmission

- Computers use IP addresses (like a home address) and MAC addresses (like a recipient's name) to identify each other on a network.

- Data is sent in packets, which are reassembled at their destination, similar to how letters are routed through postal services.
