# Limitations of the Internet

## Understanding IP Addresses

- IPv4 consists of 32 bits and can represent about 4.3 billion addresses, which is insufficient for the growing number of devices.

- IPv6, on the other hand, uses 128 bits, allowing for an extremely large number of addresses, far exceeding the number of grains of sand on Earth.

## Adoption and Usage

- The transition to IPv6 has been gradual, but it is essential for accommodating the increasing number of devices connected to the Internet.

- An example of an IPv4 address is 172.14.24.1, while an IPv6 address is significantly longer and more complex.

## Network Address Translation (NAT)

- NAT allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address, similar to how a receptionist connects calls to different internal extensions.

- This technique helps organizations manage their IP address usage more efficiently, reducing the need for multiple public IP addresses.
