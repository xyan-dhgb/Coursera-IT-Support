# Web

## Understanding the Web

- Websites are formatted using HTML, which is a coding language for web browsers.

- A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the web address used to access websites, consisting of a domain name and a domain ending (e.g., .com, .org).

## Domain Names and IP Addresses

- Domain names are registered with ICANN, and once taken, they cannot be used by others unless they become available.

- IP addresses are numerical labels assigned to devices on the internet, and DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses for navigation.

## Importance of DNS

- DNS acts as an internet directory, allowing computers to find websites using human-readable names.

- Understanding IP addresses and DNS can help diagnose network issues, especially if a website is accessible via its IP address but not its domain name.
