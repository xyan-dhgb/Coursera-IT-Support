# TCP/IP

## Understanding Network Protocols

- Network protocols are essential rules that ensure data packets are sent to the correct destination, similar to how a post office delivers letters to the right address.

- These protocols help in routing packets efficiently, maintaining data integrity, ensuring security, and proper naming conventions.

## Key Protocols: TCP and IP

- The Internet Protocol (IP) is responsible for delivering packets to the correct computers using IP addresses.

- The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ensures reliable delivery of information between networks, playing a crucial role in the development of the internet.

Overall, this section provides a foundational understanding of how the Internet operates through TCP and IP.
